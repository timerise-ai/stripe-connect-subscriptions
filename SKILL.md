  Build Stripe Connect marketplace money movement and Stripe platform subscription
  billing in a Next.js App Router app. Use when: (1) one buyer charge must split
  across several sellers — separate charges and transfers, transfer groups, escrow,
  rolling reserves, payouts to connected accounts; (2) implementing Connect account
  onboarding, `account.updated` capability flags, or debugging why a connected
  account is never funded; (3) charging tenants a recurring platform fee off-session
  with SetupIntents, saved cards and dunning; (4) reconciling gateway fees, transfer
  reversals, refund or chargeback clawbacks against a ledger; (5) the user mentions:
  Stripe Connect, connected account, transfer_group, source_transaction, separate
  charges and transfers, destination charge, application_fee_amount, acct_,
  marketplace payouts, split payment, Express onboarding, account.updated,
  off_session, SetupIntent, dunning, subscription invoices, whsec_, "merchant never
  gets paid", "Funds can't be sent to accounts located in". Carries settlement
  internals the store's atomic claims and the money tests verify: webhook
  idempotency, single-flight claims, transfer retry with adoption, and the region
  rule that decides whether a connected account can be paid at all. Next.js App
  Router oriented; backend-agnostic. Not a general checkout or PayPal skill.

# Stripe Connect & Subscription Billing

Two money flows on one Stripe account. A **marketplace** charges the buyer once
and fans the proceeds out to many merchants (Connect, *separate charges and
transfers*). A **platform subscription** charges those merchants a recurring fee
off-session (Billing). They share a client, a webhook pair and a money type.

The insight that shapes everything: **the buyer's charge and the merchants'
payouts fail independently.** By the time settlement runs the money has already
moved, so a rejected transfer must never fail the charge or the webhook, and
must stay re-drivable later without paying anyone twice.

## When to use

- One payment splits across several sellers, with the platform taking a cut.
- Sellers onboard to Connect and are paid on a delay (escrow, reserves, KYC).
- The platform bills its own sellers a recurring fee on a saved card.
- A connected account looks healthy but has never received any money.

## When NOT to use

| Not this | Use instead |
|---|---|
| Single-seller checkout, no split | Stripe Checkout / Payment Element directly |
| PayPal Marketplace onboarding + payouts | A PayPal skill; only the seams are shared |
| Card UI, Payment Element styling | Your design system; this skill is server-side |

## Architecture

```
buyer ──charge (platform account, transfer_group = orderId)──▶ platform balance
                │  settlement fan-out (webhook OR read-path sync; leased claim)
   ┌────────────┴──┬────────────────────────┬────────────────┐
   ▼               ▼                        ▼                ▼
transfer:merchant  transfer:partner    escrow hold     rolling reserve
(source_transaction = the charge)      (release_at)    (% withheld)
   │                                        │  release-escrow cron
   ▼                                        ▼
connected balance ◀── retry-transfers  payable balance ──▶ payout (KYC/risk gated)
                      (unfunded legs)

platform ──off_session PaymentIntent (customer + saved PM)──▶ subscription invoice
             dunning: 3 attempts, 3 days apart, then suspend
```

## Critical facts

1. **Separate charges and transfers, never destination charges.** A charge takes
   one `destination`; a multi-vendor cart needs N transfers under one
   `transfer_group`, so `application_fee_amount` is unusable.
2. **A transfer without `source_transaction` draws on the *available* balance**
   and is rejected while the charge is still settling; on a young platform
   account, that is every transfer. This one flag is what lets a split fund
   while the charge is still settling.
3. **Stripe transfers cross-border only inside US/CA/UK/EEA/CH.** A platform
   elsewhere pays connected accounts in its own country only. Stripe enforces
   this at transfer time, not onboarding time, so the templates apply the
   region rule at onboarding.
4. **Connect events carry a different signing secret** than platform events. Two
   endpoints, two secrets, one URL — verify against both.
5. **A connected account's country is immutable** — wrong country means
   re-onboarding, not a patch.
6. **Money is never a float** — `numeric(19,4)` strings end to end, `bigint` math,
   minor units only at the SDK edge.

## Hard rules

> **Never let a failed transfer fail the settlement.** Record the leg unfunded
> and continue. The charge has already succeeded, so the webhook must succeed
> too; the retry cron funds the leg later.

> **Never treat a duplicate webhook insert as "already handled".** The insert is
> a *claim*; the retry after a delivery crashed mid-handling re-runs the
> handlers, so every event runs to completion exactly once.

> **Never re-send a transfer without asking Stripe whether it already exists.** A
> leg recorded unfunded because the *response* was lost pays twice once Stripe's
> 24h idempotency window passes.

> **Never derive settlement exclusivity from a status flag written at the end.**
> Two callers reach settlement routinely; an atomic leased claim is what makes
> inventory and transfers happen once.

> **Never reverse more than a transfer's remaining headroom.** Stacked reversals
> (gateway fee, then a refund) are rejected past the original amount.

## Quick start

1. Model the money — [money.md](references/money.md), [data-model.md](references/data-model.md), [store.md](references/store.md).
2. Client, dual webhook secrets, env — [stripe-adapter.md](references/stripe-adapter.md).
3. Onboard accounts; **check the region rule first** — [connect-accounts.md](references/connect-accounts.md).
4. Receive events idempotently — [webhooks.md](references/webhooks.md).
5. Settle: claim, fan out, escrow, reserve — [settlement.md](references/settlement.md).
6. Converge: retry legs, reconcile fees — [reconciliation.md](references/reconciliation.md).
7. Bill tenants — [subscriptions.md](references/subscriptions.md); run it with [operations.md](references/operations.md).

Fit it to your app with [adaptation.md](references/adaptation.md); the record of
the audit is in [provenance.md](references/provenance.md).
